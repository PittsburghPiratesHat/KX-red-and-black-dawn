POLITICS_MARMADUKE_GROVE_DESC:0 "Grove was born in the northern city of Copiapó on 6 July 1878 to José Marmaduke Grove Abalos, a lawyer, and Ana Vallejo Burgoa. In 1891, his father was exiled for opposing President José Manuel Balmaceda. Despite his early opposition to the ruling authorities, he joined the Chilean naval academy in 1892. Exiled due to his socialist tendencies, he was chosen to perform a role as a liaison in Great Britain, effectively just to keep him out of Chile. But there he took part in the Revolution, and during his exile, During the rule of President Ibañez Del Campo, Chile's economy worsened and in 1931 the country went bankrupt. Shortly after this, Ibañez was deposed when most of the army and navy mutinied, allowing for Grove's return to Chile and the proclamation of the Socialist Republic. His recent ascension to the post of Chairman is one that clearly signals that both Military and Civil authorities in Chile consider conflict with Argentina nigh inevitable after years of support for the Patagonian rebels."

### Focuses ###
CHL_air:0 "Update Air Force Philosophy"
CHL_air_desc:0 "Our air doctrines are still a relic of the time of early aviation, and what was once cutting edge now belongs in a museum. Our pilots and planning will be updated accordingly."
CHL_air2:0 "Aerial Production"
CHL_air2_desc:0 "The sudden cut of funding for the air force is perhaps a key factor why it joined us in the Revolution; now we should take the utmost care to ensure that our airplanes are both modern and well cared for. Thankfully, we have comrades from the Union of Britain who can me most helpful in this endeavour."
CHL_fighter:0 "Fighter Effort"
CHL_fighter2:0 "Close Air Support Craft" #CAS
CHL_fighter3:0 "Long Range Aircraft Experiments" #long range aircraft
CHL_fighter_desc:0 "Aerial supremacy is key in modern war, of that few can doubt; But the advent of new mechanisms of war means that our old biplanes are not suitable for defending the skies of Chile anymore."
CHL_fighter2_desc:0 "Air superiority could be meaningless if we cannot capitalise in help for our troops on the frontlines; not only special aircraft is required, but specific training too."
CHL_fighter3_desc:0 "Our country is, from an strategic standpoint, too long in a North-South axis to be properly protected by common fighter craft. We must ensure, with the help of our comrades in Europe, that our Air Force has planes capable of long autonomous flights."
CHL_airdoc:0 "Aerial Strategy"
CHL_airdoc2_desc:0 "The engagements themselves are also to be analysed, and our few planes cannot be foolishly thrown away. Careful studying and manoeuvres will be key in our coming victory."
CHL_airdoc_desc:0 "Aerial engagements are quick and brutal affairs; and it pays to plan for them and strategic missions beforehand. What will be the focus of our air force in the war to come, our general staff must decide."
CHL_airdoc2:0 "Aerial Tactics"
CHL_bomber:0 "Bomber Effort"
CHL_bomber_desc:0 "The role of a bomber craft is somewhat new, but its uses were made apparent many times. In order to make sure we can defend the fatherland, our Weltkrieg era models will have to be replaced."
CHL_bomber2:0 "Modern Bomber Craft"
CHL_bomber2_desc:0 "Not only as to make Bombers an active, modernise part of our air force, but to also make sure they are up to date, we will continue investing on different, role based Bomber Craft!"

CHL_navy_desc:0 "Our fleet, with its recent additions and investments in the term of Chairman Puga, is perhaps the most powerful in South America; it is most certainly the most well armed fighting force of the South Pacific, and well capable of both defensive and offensive operations."
CHL_highseas:0 "A High Seas Navy"
CHL_highseas_desc:0 "The decisive battles of the wars to come will be fought on deep waters, away from coastal support. In order to make sure our navy is ready for this crucial engagement against a certain undisclosed enemy to the West, we will make drills, exercises and planning efforts."
CHL_dockyard:0 "Fleet Renewal"
CHL_dockyard_desc:0 "Our fleet, while well armed and well supplied, has many second hand or outdated vessels; If we are to modernise it, we must spare no expense in dockyards, shipyards and weapon systems."
CHL_carry2:0 "Aircraft Carrier Effort"
CHL_carry2_desc:0 "Many experts believe in the importance of Aircraft carriers in a naval engagement; this is especially true in our republic, given how a great many influential staff members have an air force background. While monumentally expensive, a modern aircraft carrier might mean the difference between victory and defeat."
CHL_cafi:0 "Naval Strike Aircraft"
CHL_cafi_desc:0 "Naval Aircraft has always been a key factor of national defence; most of our important military centres are within range of naval artillery. It's a matter of the utmost importance to ensure we can defend our coastline from foreign aggression."

CHL_bb:0 "Commission more Battleships"
CHL_bb_desc:0 "The Almirante Latorre class battleship is a fine vessel, but one that shows its age, even with the small upgrades we outfitted. We will likely require a new flagship to ensure our national security."
CHL_highseas2:0 "Blue Water Navy"
CHL_highseas2_desc:0 "Even more emphasis on Deep Water tactics, doctrines and manoeuvres will be required if our navy is to have against chance against its enemies. Practice makes perfect."
CHL_sub:0 "Submarine Ventures"
CHL_sub_desc:0 "Our current submarine fleet is small and outdated, and thus we require more recent, well armed models to keep imperialist navies at their toes."
CHL_des:0 "Anti Submarine Effort"
CHL_des_desc:0 "Our efforts to hunt down enemy submarines may end fruitless if our smaller ships are not modern enough, putting both our flagships and our shipping lanes at risk. We must not allow that to happen."
CHL_ls:0 "Commerce Raiders"
CHL_ls_desc:0 "Even if our navy is among the most powerful of the South, imperialist forces from Germany, the United States and Argentina could possibly make us have to rely on asymmetrical naval warfare, in order to compensate for our lack of tonnage and manpower."
CHL_arms_of_the_revolution:0 "A Nation Under Siege"
CHL_arms_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The biggest danger to Chile is not internal, but that of the resurrecting counter-revolutionary Argentina. They do little to hide their ambitions on our territory since the birth of their nation in the 1800s, and now, emboldened by Brazilian incompetence, wish to see Chile conquered. We will not let happen!"
CHL_mobility_potential:0 "Mobility Potential"
CHL_mobility_potential_desc:0 "Many have heard ideas and plans about how modern warfare will be a fast-paced, mechanised affair; even if that may not turn out to be the case, we do not have the manpower to engage in traditional war with Argentina and the other imperialists. We will do our best to improve the mobility of our forces."
CHL_communard_expertise:0 "Foreign Armour Expertise"
CHL_communard_expertise_desc:0 "Mobility has always been of great import on the battlefield. With developments in motorization and mechanization, a new generation of officers the world over have begun to promote more aggressive styles of warfare utilizing those new technologies. We should hire such men from abroad."
CHL_tanque:0 "Tank Effort"
CHL_tanque_desc:0 "Our military requires not only tanks, but tanks that are modern, autonomous and can deal with the harsh terrain of our homeland. Advanced war machinery may mean the difference between victory and defeat."
CHL_tanque2:0 "Tank Production Effort"
CHL_tanque2_desc:0 "We cannot mechanise our forces properly with simple imports; we must ensure our factories can supply our armed forces by themselves, for we cannot depend on other nations on such vital matters."
CHL_army_rearmament:0 "Army Rearmament"
CHL_army_rearmament_desc:0 "While the army is not underpaid or underfed as it used to be before the Revolution, it is still poorly equipped. Let us attend to the needs of our officers and ensure our Army can fight off any threats."

CHL_infeq2:0 "Modern Military Equipment"
CHL_infeq2_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, the equipment in our military is not entirely up to modern standards. Our officers will require more spending and attention from our government, but the vanguard of the revolution deserves only the best!"
CHL_arty2:0 "Firepower Effort"

CHL_mountaineers:0 "Mountaineer Brigade Expansion"
CHL_mountaineers_desc:0 "The Mountains that surround us are an integral part of any national defence plan in case of invasion. Passes, peaks and hillsides must not be garrisoned with fresh recruits, but with elite specially trained regiments who are ready for the harsh reality of mountain life."
CHL_andean_strategy:0 "Andean Strategy"
CHL_andean_strategy_desc:0 "The so-called Santiago Line will be the last stand of our nation, if Argentina overpowers us and crossed the Andes. The rough terrain near and around Santiago will be made impenetrable to foreign invaders, which will allow us to resist even the harshest numerical disadvantage."
CHL_long_term_planning:0 "Long Term Planning"
CHL_long_term_planning_desc:0 "Not only battles and combat engagements are important, but the very movement and organisation of both our forces and that of our enemies will be thoroughly studied, and prepare our general staff for the challenge of the coming War of Imperialism."

CHL_permanet:0 "Permanent Revolution Doctrine"
CHL_permanet_desc:0 "Something that Labarcists defend, the idea that the Revolution can only be maintained by force, for reactionary elements cannot be reasoned or bargained with. The Proletarian Dictatorship will be permanent until it's not longer necessary."
CHL_directrule:0 "Centralised Planning"
CHL_directrule_desc:0 "All decisions about he economic and state well being must be consulted with Central Committees in Santiago. To do otherwise would be clumsy at best, treason at worst."
CHL_chairmanmega:0 "Extend Chairman's Powers"
CHL_chairmanmega_desc:0 "The Chairman still requires approval from the Syndicalist Congress for many actions, something that greatly cripples the capacity of our state to react. We must change this!"
CHL_commisariats:0 "Revolutionary Commissars"

CHL_helicopter_rides_desc:0 "Some individuals still cling to counter-revolutionary ideals, and would never let them go. There is a place where they can keep said ideas: The Easter Island. Of course, bad things always happen in such long trips..."

CHL_extended_desc:0 "The Congress of Syndicates is now a true house of democracy, unlike the parliament of the Old Republic. However, it is still quite powerless in many matters, a relic of our over-centralising presidentialist past. We must remedy this!"

Against him runs the young Salvador Allende and his party Falange Nacional, influenced by the ideas of Legionarism and Sorelianism. Also, with rather minute chances, the Totalists, influenced by the ideas of European Socialists like Mosley and Beira, are running with Labarca as their frontman.

Even through the rampant corruption of the congress and more bloody civil war occurred, a phase of economic prosperity was initiated in the nation, supported by the high demand for saltpeter at the beginning of Weltkrieg.\n\nHowever, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpeter, rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence, especially under the disastrous rule of Carlos Ibañez Del Campo, during which Chile bankrupted, in 1931. Shortly afterwards. Ibañez was deposed, and the navy and most of the army mutinied, and with the support of the people, and the of arrival of reinforcements from the long-exiled Marmaduke Grove arriving from the Union of Britain, the Syndicalist Republic of Chile was proclaimed.\n\nDuring these 5 years, the economy instead of being rebuilt, its worsened, the inflation reached to the inhumane peaks, all education reforms failed, administrative ones also failed, to make it worse, constant political violence perpetuated by nobody but themselves, through violent crashes between anarchists, totalists, syndicalist and other groups, to the point of the absurd, leaded the country to verge of collapse.\n\nWhich is worse, is the hated towards the first and unique chairman of the nation, Arturo Puga, moderated for some, extremist for others, a danger and reactionary, a monster that should be executed along all the government, there is not in-betweens, and the country only knows violence as a way to solve this conflict, there only one side will emerge as victorious of the this infighting."
